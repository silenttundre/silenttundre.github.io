Bubba the Bubb Road Bear
Local Icon
Bubba the Bubb Road Bear was born on October 11th, 2015. It was originally an old pine tree that had died due to the drought. But the tree's owner, Sarah Kopy, didn't want to remove the stump because the sidewalk in that area is uneven, and posed a potential hazard for pedestrians.

So, Ms. Sarah came up with an idea: Why not carve a bear from the stump? She hired a tree carver from Humboldt named Glenn Severson, even paying for him to stay at the Cupertino Motel for two days to complete the carving. She wanted a “happy bear” carved because everyone loves bears.

Bubba the Bubb Road Bear faces the pedestrian crossing, a spot where many school kids pass on their way to and from school. He’s such an icon on Bubb Road that neighbors have donated scarves and decorations for him. Bubba has a Facebook page, and all are welcome to share their pictures of or with Bubba.

Bubba is a true Cupertinian. He’s very diverse and celebrates something every month, including Chinese New Year (complete with a dragon), Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, Cinco de Mayo, Juneteenth, the last day of school, spring, summer, back-to-school season, Halloween, Diwali, and, of course, Christmas. Bubba has many fans and even some special friends who take selfies with him and give him hugs.

If you have an event you'd like to celebrate, consider leaving a note and/or a decoration for Ms. Sarah. She may accommodate your request if time and health permit. We thank Ms. Sarah for all her efforts in decorating Bubba. God bless her and Bubba!
