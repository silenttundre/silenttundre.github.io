George Chong
Cupertino Little League President
The Cupertino Little League has been a community institution in this city since 1962. It relies on countless hours of volunteer time from residents like George Chong to bring the sport of baseball to hundreds of children and teens each year. Chong, the current Board President, originally became involved in the Little League because he was so grateful to the other parents who coached selflessly for his own son.

Now, Chong oversees all of the league's many teams, including T-Ball, Minor, Majors, Juniors and Seniors Leagues, and a Challengers division for those who are physically and mentally challenged. The league is an all-volunteer army with many families volunteering to coach, organize fundraising, and all the logistics needed for a season. Cupertino Little League continues to bring together local families and students each year, building a true community that supports one another.
