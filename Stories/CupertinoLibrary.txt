Cupertino Library
Organization
The Cupertino Library is the busiest library in Santa Clara County. It has the highest number of patrons and has long served as a central gathering place for both kids and adults in Cupertino. However, it wasn’t always in the beautiful, majestic building we see today—it had humbler beginnings. The first Cupertino Library was housed in the Cupertino Store at the northeast corner of Stevens Creek Road and De Anza Boulevard. On December 8th, 1960, the library then moved to its current location, originally the Allario Shopping Center. At that time, patrons would enter at the top and go down to the children’s section.

Our library stood strong through the Loma Prieta earthquake. During the quake, books were strewn all over. Some aisles had piles high enough that someone could have been buried underneath. Fortunately, no one was under those piles.

Last year, the current library celebrated its 20th anniversary. And in 2022, new activity rooms were added with the help of Cupertino Library Foundation funds. The Cupertino Library Foundation is now looking at a facelift for the aquarium, and the Santa Clara County Library system is further enhancing the kids’ section.
